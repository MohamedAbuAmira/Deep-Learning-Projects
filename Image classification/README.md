# Image classification Projects

**Those my Deep Learning projects related to image classifications** 
<p> You can run them in Google Colab, all notebooks uploaded on this repository. </p>
<p> Also I put all links of my notebooks in Kaggle </p>

## The projects
1. [CNN Model Image Classification for Malaria Cell](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bS4FVYLMQ9PopFRFfTBHLqivZ0z_C91z?usp=sharing)
   - Use CNN model with RMSprop as optimizer to classify malaria images. I get accuracy of 94% on test data. The data downloaded from Kaggle
2. [CNN Model Image Classification for Skin Cancer](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mT6gY3rLm4oXYf5IaIfEjZuwTSDolBNU?usp=sharing)
   - Use CNN model with RMSprop as optimizer to classify skin cancer images. I get accuracy of 65% on test data.
